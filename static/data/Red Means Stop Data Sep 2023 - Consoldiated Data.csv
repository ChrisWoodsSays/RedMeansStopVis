I've never stood at a crossroads for an hour before and just watched! Nobody approached me or asked what I was doing. It didn't rain! I was pleasantly surprised that the vast majority of drivers did heed the red light. 14 is obviously 14 too many, but I think I expected it would be significantly higher.","I didn't feel like I was monitoring the greatest threat of harm to pedestrians at the junction. During the hour I witnessed (but obviously didn't attempt to count/record) amongst other horrors: aggressive driving, unnecessary car horn use, mobile phone use, drug driving (NO2), speeding, loads of 'amber gambling' (accelerating towards lights and narrowly clearing the white line on the amber phase, when braking and stopping would be appropriate and safe). But the biggest danger of all was cars coming from the other three directions - travelling northbound (i.e. on A453 towards city centre) driving through the pedestrian green person phase at the set of lights I was monitoring. This was probably a mixture of red light running, and congestion meaning vehicles were 'stranded' in the middle of the crossroads when the lights changed but then instead of waiting for the lights to change again, drivers routinely proceeded to drive through the green person phase on the pedestrian crossing. On one cycle 5 vehicles went through the same green person! I witnessed a number of pedestrians attempting to cross including those that gestured to drivers e.g. by pointing at the green man or holding up their palm. I would guess at least 30 vehicles drove through the green phase, but none of them are captured by my results above. Perhaps a team of 3 or 4 people monitoring for different offences during the same hour period?"
